# 📊 Task 3 - Decision Tree Classifier for Purchase Prediction  
### 🚀 Prodigy Infotech – Data Science Internship

## 🧠 Project Objective

As part of the Data Science Internship at **Prodigy Infotech**, this task involves building a **Decision Tree Classifier** to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their **demographic and behavioral data**.

We use the **Bank Marketing Dataset** from the **UCI Machine Learning Repository**, which contains real-world marketing data collected by a Portuguese bank.

## 📁 Dataset Information

**Dataset Name:** Bank Marketing Dataset  
**Source:** [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing)  
**Format:** CSV (`bank.csv`)  
**Target Variable:** `y` (Yes/No – did the customer subscribe to a term deposit?)

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib** – Data visualization
- **Scikit-learn (sklearn)** – ML model building & evaluation

## 🔁 Workflow

1. Load and explore the dataset
2. Preprocess data (handle missing values, encode categoricals)
3. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Train/Test split
5. Build Decision Tree Classifier
6. Evaluate model performance
7. Visualize the decision tree and metrics
